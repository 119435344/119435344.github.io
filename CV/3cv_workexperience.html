			<p><b>Junior accountant at Seismic Forensics Ltd. </b></br>
			<i>2017 - present</i> </br>
			I aid the senior accountant by sorting and verifying the company’s 
			expenses for tax purposes. I do preliminary calculations to 
			approximate how much VAT is due, in order to aid in financial 
			planning, before formal VAT calculations are done by the senior 
			accountant. </p>
		
		
			<p><b>Assistant Field Geophysicist </b></br>
			<i>June 2018</i> </br>
			I accompanied an experienced geophysicist into the Moroccan desert 
			on a month long expedition with the aim of testing a gadget he 
			built to detect air pollution. I assisted in packing and 
			maintaining supplies and was entirely responsible for recording 
			all expenses throughout the trip and sorting these into the relevant 
			catagories. </p>

			<p><b>Bühnentechikerin, Schiller Gymnasium </b></br>
			<i>2014 - 2017</i> </br>
			I played a large role in my German school’s Bühnentechnik AG 
			(Stage technology crew) and received recognition both within 
			the school and district for my dedication, volunteer hours, and 
			commitment. After moving to my school in Ireland, I volunteered 
			to help with the stage technology and set up a small stage technology
			 crew as their previously had been none. </p>

			1 month of work experience in the English bookshop in Berlin 
			taught me many skills including customer service abilities,
			organisational skills, crisis handling, as well as placing orders
			for book shipments, price appraisal and book shelving systems. </p>
